==================================

1.		add in calls to action for each project--button bgs?
X2.		every time user locates a new project, have the forest image slide in (and reveal more of the image--cross-fade)
X3.		include pop-up with text explaining connection between retrofitting buildings and the health of forests, e.g., every time a metric ton of CO2 is 		
		eliminated from the atmosphere, our forests breathe easier...
X4.		have the map expand and recede--have map full screen on start?
5.		refine world map color change, green flags
6.		at world level, CO2 meter (red/brown); with greening of each city, have red bg fill in with green (maybe at the end have the bar fade away to reveal 
		tree line)
X7.		fix the "feather duster" progress meter (conifer)
X8.  	intro page animation / pop-up screen; instructions
9.		work out initial state
10. 	info / how-to links at top; resources links...
11.		tweak map & intro map animation (option to expand map)
12.  	refine stuff
		-make cities on map have fine point
